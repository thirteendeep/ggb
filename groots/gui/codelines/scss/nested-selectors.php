    <h3>Nested Selectors</h3>
    <p>
        Nested selectors can become overwhelming and confusing if you're not carefull with them.
        That's why groots decided to apply the "Don't nest selectors over three levels deep" rule.
        It helps writing css that is robust, flexible and reusable.
