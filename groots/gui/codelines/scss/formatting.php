    <h3>Formatting</h3>
    <p>
        All the rules that we apply on <a href="#c-cssFormatting" gr-scroll-to=".gui-nav" gr-scroll-to-bottom="0">css formatting</a> must be applied
        with scss but since the syntax is different, here are some additional rules
        that groots respects when developing with sass :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When doing mathematical operations, make sure that you wrap them with parentheses and add spaces between the operator and the values to make it easier to read.</li>
        <li>When using <a href="#c-scssVariables" gr-scroll-to=".gui-nav" gr-scroll-to-bottom="0">variables</a> in your mathematical operations, use values that make sens so that other developers will understand why you use them.</li>
        <li><a href="http://csslint.net/" target="_blank">Lint</a> error code : <span class="lint--valid">None</span></li>
    </ul>
